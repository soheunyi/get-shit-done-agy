# Summary: Plan 1.1

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ **Update Root README**: Added "Developing GSD" section and "Safe Update Workflow" documentation.
- ✅ **Verify Antigravity Support README**: Confirmed installation instructions are correct.

## Verification
- `grep` checks confirmed new sections exist in Root README.
- `grep` check confirmed installation instruction in Support README.

## Context
- `README.md` now accurately reflects the dual-structure of this repository (Root = Dev, Support = Dist) and explains the safety mechanisms we built in Phase 6.
